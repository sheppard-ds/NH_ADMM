# Enterprise Data Model Phytoplankton
### Model creation date

### Model last update date

### Name
Phytoplankton
### Theme
what are the key themes to this entity.
### Unique Identifiers
What are the unique identifiers and is there a system for their creation/ generation
### Definition
Some phytoplankton are toxin producing algae.

Water samples are collected from selected sites within classified shellfish growing areas and analysed for various species of phytoplankton including:
*   Alexandrium
*   Dinophysis
*   Pseudo-nitzschia

Monitoring for phytoplankton provides an early warning of toxic events. It can also help you make decisions on additional monitoring activities.

### What it is not
*   biotoxin results
*   microbiology results

### Synonyms
*   Water results
*   Alexandrium
*   Dinophysis
*   Pseudo-nitzschia

### Key Properties
The properties that would be shared across all implementations of this entity because they are fundamental to it. These can have a little more detail, and where possible should link out to data patterns in our data pattern library.
#### Controlled Vocabularies
The alert level Phytoplankton concentration for each species is:

*   Alexandrium (Saxitoxin), it is greater than or equal to 40 cells/litre of Alexandrium - Responsible for PSP
*   Dinophysis (Okadaic Acid), it is greater than or equal to 100 cells/litre of Dinophysis, and by historical data – Responsible for DSP
*   Pseudo-nitzschia (Domoic Acid), it is greater than or equal to 150,000 cells/litre of Pseudo-nitzschia, and historical data – Responsible for ASP

#### Contextual Properties
The properties that are most common in specific implementations of the entity, might be best to link out to subclasses if the relationship is that strong i.e. Establishment > Approved Establishment
