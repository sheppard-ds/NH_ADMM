### Definition
Establishments are the central unit of enrolment within food and feed related legisation. The key fields of an establishment are its premises and its operator. A change in either of these gives rise to a different establishment. Other changes, such as changes in establishment type or the mix of activities requiring registration or approval which it undertakes, trigger a change of establishment.

### What it is not
As far as the FSA is concerned an establishment is only an establishment if it is related to food. This means that your local phone shop is not counted as an establishment as far as the FSA is concerned.
