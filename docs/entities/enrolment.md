### Description
Enrolment is an FSA record of an Establishment to register or seek approval to perform food and feed related activities or be part of a recognised scheme.  

Enrolment is a combination of entities; [Scheme](/enterprise-data-models/entities/scheme.html), [Competent Authority](/enterprise-data-models/entities/competent-authority.html), and [Establishment](/enterprise-data-models/entities/establishment.html). A change in either of these may require a new application for Enrolement.

Enrolment in new schemes does not necessarily impact on existing schemes you are enrolled in.
